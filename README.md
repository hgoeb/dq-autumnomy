Komodo IDE Color Scheme: Dark Warm Gray inspired by autumn colors


### Important Note ! ###
I have developed the color scheme using the following fonts
* Hack (for editor)
* Encode Sans (for Interface and Widgets)

You may want to install them first.  
You can always overwrite my font setting with your personal preferences.
